 <title>Alex Zoghlin's Hiring Manifesto</title>

<body>

<div class=WordSection1>

<p >Preamble: I am making the fundamental assumption that VHT is
already doing all of the basics necessary to assist in keeping the company
staffed. Thus, I will not address benefits, screening process, testing
methodologies, background checks, staff augmentation or other areas usually
associated with candidate sourcing, or the normal course of business for an
employee of the company. This document will specifically address long and short
term strategies to position the company as the preeminent place to work for
Alpha geeks in Chicago.</p>

<p ><b s><span
>EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY</span></b><span> &#8211; VHT has the opportunity to redefine itself in the
Chicago development community as the premiere location for self motivated GREAT
DEVELOPERS. Through a comprehensive plan to widen the funnel of potential
candidates, and redefining recruitment within the development groups as a
prerequisite for success, the company will be able to turbo charge innovation
and productivity from the development team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span >I believe in the concentric circle of change &#8211; start
with changing the things you are already doing to make them more effective,
then, after the have had an effect (and have been tried, and improved a couple
of cycles), you start to add new things the company isn't doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span >So, I will start out the change process with recommending a
radical change by adding a written test we will give each prospective developer.
A well written test given to every applicant is one of the most effective tools
for self selection, as well as a great indicator for future success within the
organization. Unfortunately, most companies (VHT included) either don't do it,
or create a technical test that tries to provide an indicator of technical
proficiency in a specific technology or programming language. THIS IS WORTHLESS
unless the company is in the business of staff augmentation, which we are not.
Languages change, technologies change, and great companies change with them.
The company needs a social test that asks the prospective applicant if they
have the character traits most often associated with highly successful self
motivated great programmers. .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p >Here would be an example</p>

<p >All yes/no questions.</p>

<p>1. You're more of a pragmatist than a perfectionist</p>

<p>2. You've muttered &quot;I'm up anyways, might as well code&quot; at 4:30 a.m.
at least once in your life.</p>

<p>3. You understand why the above is misleading because time is continuous,
not discrete and the probability of any individual having muttered anything at
exactly 4:30 a.m. is near zero. But, you answered yes to #2 anyways, because
you're practical and know what was actually meant.</p>

<p>4. Your sense of satisfaction from software development is a function of how
many users are delighted with what you've built.</p>

<p>5. You can argue both sides of a technical debate most of the time, if you
had to. Some of the time, you actually do, just to better understand the
tradeoffs.</p>

<p>6. You've been impressed with someone else's code at some point in your
life.</p>

<p>7. You've reused someone else's code at some point in your life, and
resisted the temptation to rewrite it.</p>

<p>8. Given a weekend, you could build and launch a trivial web application
from start to finish in a language/platform of your choosing (C#<span
class=GramE>,<span class=SpellE>Java,PHP,Python,Ruby,etc</span></span>.). And,
since you've actually had weekends, you've actually gone ahead and done this.</p>

<p>9. You're strangely comforted by the fact that the list of languages in #8
is alphabetical and not in descending or ascending order of
quality/power/coolness/etc as you really don't have the time for a religious
war on languages and platforms.</p>

<p>10. Given a long weekend and some caffeine, you could do #8 with a popular
language/platform that is not of your choosing.</p>

<p>11. You've developed something non-trivial before that nobody you know could
recreate in a weekend (and you know more than two people that you'd consider
great developers).</p>

<p>12. You're going to start your own company someday. So, you're interested in
sales, marketing, operations and things other than figuring out how to make
Ruby on Rails scale to large numbers of users when there are complicated database
queries involved.</p>

<p>13. You read a lot, including things like Slashdot and hacker news.</p>

<p>14. You're not just an internet developer, you're an internet participant.
You actually use the stuff other people have built.</p>

<p>I won't go into detail on each question, but suffice it to say, each one of
these questions delves quite deeply into the psyche of a <span class=SpellE>a</span>
great developer <span >&nbsp;</span>and this type of
questionnaire will not only weed out the chaff, but will be a very effective
reinforcing recruiting tool for the right applicant.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The interview process:</p>

<p>The company already does interviews. To the best of my knowledge, the company
has no idea which employees are good interviewers, and which ones are not.
Worse, I couldn't seem to find any process the company used to track the 'success'
of new hires based upon who interviewed them to get any indication of who was
successful. Given that, the company needs to start from scratch on creating the
right interview process</p>

<p><span >&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interview process is
the most important part of hiring great talent, and the one area in which most
companies fall down. Most developers are untrained in the 'art' of the
interview, and usually resort to turning an interview into a technical
inquisition. Remember, asking specific technical questions will not be able to
differentiate proficient programmers from great programmers, so don't bother.
Worse, looking for specific answers to specific technical questions will in
fact scare away potential great candidates that know there is more than one
technical answer to any problem, and the correct answer will change over time
&#8211; a great company will know this, and shouldn't bother asking the
question. A candidate interview is a dual interview; the candidate is
interviewing the company for the right fit, and the company is interviewing the
candidate. For this reason, it is EXTREMELY important that the company ensures
that it's best and brightest <span class=GramE>are</span> part of the process
&#8211; great developers want to work with great developers. Inviting mediocre
developers to the process because they are 'free' and the great ones are busy
is the fastest way to mediocrity for any organization.</p>

<p>So, if an interview isn't a technical inquisition, what is it? The short
answer, it's like flirting at a bar &#8211; you are trying to get to know each
other and see if there is common ground. Fundamentally, great developers have a
lot of characteristics in common, while mediocre developers also share similar
traits. Below is a list of traits, both good and bad that a developer should be
on the lookout for during an interview process:</p>

<p>In my work with Sabre, I met a kind of technical guy I'd never met before:
the career programmer. This is a person who's doing IT because they think it's
a good career. They don't do any programming in their spare time. They're
shocked when they find out I have a 22TB server farm in my basement for 'fun'. They
just do it at work. They don't learn new stuff unless sent on a training
program (or motivated by the need to get a job that requires that technology).
They do ÒprogrammingÓ as a day job. They don't really want to talk about it
outside of work. When they do, they talk with a distinctive lack of enthusiasm.
Basically, they lack passion.</p>

<p>Great developers are always passionate about programming. Great developers
would do some programming even if they weren't being paid for it. Great
programmers will have a tendency to talk your ear off about some technical
detail of what they're working on (but while clearly believing, sincerely, that
what they're talking about is really worth talking about). Some people might
see that as maladapted social skills (which it is), but if you want to
recognize a great developer, this passion for what they're doing at the expense
of social smoothness is a very strong indicator. Can you get this person to
excitedly talk about a technology that he's using, for a whole half hour,
without losing steam? If so, you've found a winner.</p>

<p>Pattern: passionate about what they are working on &#8211; physically
excited when asked to describe their latest work. <span class=GramE>Hard to
keep quiet.</span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Antipattern</span>:<span >&nbsp;
</span>difficult to get them to discuss their work. Asking them to describe
some work they've done is like a dental exam for both of you.</p>

<p>Now, I need to point something out &#8211; There are some great developers
that are so introverted that they couldn't show this kind of passion in front
of a stranger during an interview process. They are great developers, but given
VHT culture, they probably won't make great developers at this company. Since
all of the products at this company are <span class=GramE>virtual</span>, the
development team holds a special place, and is more accountable to the rest of
the organization for the success of failure of any given project. Thus, a great
programmer needs to have the proper inter-personal skills, and outgoing
personality necessary to show this type of enthusiasm to anyone they are in
contact with.</p>

<p  style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Training<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Programming is the ultimate moving target. Not a year goes by without some
new technology robbing an old, established standard blind and changing half the
development universe. This is not to say that all good programmers pick up
these changes and ride the bleeding edge. However, there's a class of
programmers that will never, ever pick up a new technology unless forced to,
because they don't like learning new stuff. These programmers will typically
have learnt programming at university, and expect to get by on whatever skills
they picked up there, plus whatever courses their company is willing to send
them on.</p>

<p>If you're interviewing a candidate, and he or she ever utters the words ÒI
can work with that, just send me on a training course for a week and I'll be
good at itÓ, don't hire that person. A great programmer doesn't need a training
course to learn a new technology. In fact, the great programmer will be the one
talking your ear off about a new technology that you haven't even heard of,
explaining to you why you <strong>must</strong> use it in your business, even
if none of your staff knows how to use it. Even if it's a technology he doesn't
know how to use yet.</p>

weaknesses (of which there are many) not to try and &quot;fix them&quot; -
which I'm not sure is possible, but to understand them, work around them, and
hire others without the weaknesses to increase the probability of success. A
great example of this is you will NEVER see me negotiating price with a
customer. I am a great negotiator when it comes to micromanaging vendors for
lower prices and higher services, but when faced with the opposite situation,
I'm always a sucker and will give away the store. Since I know this about
myself you will never see me on a call or in a meeting with a customer where
price could possibly come up without our head of national Sales, Kevin McGuire
in attendance with strict instructions to take over the conversation and
solicit no input from me in the process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

because almost every book in my library is written by people with experience in
business administration or psychology <span class=SpellE>vs</span> training in
software development or creation. In fact, I could argue that almost by
definition if someone is a trained practitioner in software development, they
are not only not interested in business administration, they are nauseated by
the concept which results in books like the mythical man month which have GREAT
concepts, but are more often used as quotable phrase book mediocre developers
can use to avoid accountability. At some point, I'll write a different
manifesto how agile development methodologies have found the real problem that
plagued the development of OS/360 in mythical man month (I'll give you a hint:
large system development doesn't have a communication overhead, it has a
dependency overhead &#8211; many teams are waiting for other teams to finish before
they can finish development. An easy problem to solve given the right context)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

heard from me, Software development is different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Software development is different because only the best people significantly
contribute to achievement. Traditional management texts assume a distribution
of talent among the workers. Each worker is contributing something useful and
the challenge is to get each one to perform at his or her maximum potential. In
the same factory, the best worker may produce two or three times as much as the
average, but all the workers are contributing. In software engineering a good
programmer is at least 10 times more productive than an average programmer (The
only good piece of quantitative data from the Òmythical man monthÓ Brooks 1995).
If a product is being developed rapidly, the average programmers will consume
nearly their entire work day just in reading and understanding the new code
generated by the good programmers. Thus the challenges of a software
engineering manager first and foremost are (1) creating a work environment
where good programmers will be satisfied enough to stay, and (2) creating a
system via which average programmers can become good. In an ideal software
engineering organization, there are still some average-quality people but these
should be viewed as being apprenticed to the best people and being taught as
fast as possible. </p>

<p>Software development is different because people at all levels of the
organization perceive themselves to be equally intelligent. Consensus-style
management can perhaps work when there is a gradient of perceived ability.
Given enough time, the less able workers will follow the lead of the more able
workers. One of the paradoxes of software engineering is that people with bad
ideas and low productivity often think of themselves as supremely capable. They
are the last people whom one can expect to fall in line with a good strategy
developed by someone else. As for the good programmers who are in fact
supremely capable, there is no reason to expect consensus to form among them.
Each programmer thinks his or her idea about what to build and how to build it
is the best. (Thus, my request for you to read the Kruger &amp; Dunning
Article) </p>

<p>Software development is different because a leaf-node worker is more expert
than any manager, even when the manager is a great engineer, in at least the
small portion of the system that the leaf-node worker has personally built.
This makes it difficult for a manager to engage in a technical argument with a
worker. It becomes nearly impossible when the manager's technical skills are
weak. The worker can spin castles of complexity in the air and come up with
impressive-to-the-MBA excuses for why it has to be done a certain way or on a
certain schedule. </p>

<p>Software development is different because the organization can't afford to
lose the individual productivity of the best people by pushing them into
management. A truly great programmer may generate 10 times as much business
value as a merely good programmer. Can the organization afford to take someone
who can do the work of 100 average programmers and push him or her into a pure
management role? <span class=GramE>Probably not.</span> Can the organization
afford to put people with weak technical skills into management roles? <span
class=GramE>Probably not.</span> Once you give Joe MBA a title and ask him to
coordinate eventually he will be making decisions that have engineering
implications. Thus many of the best programmers are eventually forced at least
to assume project leadership and mentoring responsibilities. Since they are
still expected to produce designs, software, documentation, and journal
articles, the danger is that the new manager will become glued to his or her
screen and never look up to see how the project team is doing. </p>

<p>Software development is different because measurement is notoriously
difficult. The world is full of products that failed due to overly complex and
tasteless designs. Yet all of these designs were considered tasteful by their
architects. Systems that experts evaluated and found wanting, such as the Unix
operating system (1970), eventually proved to have great utility. It is a bit
easier to count up the lines of code per day produced by a programmer but if
the project was not very tightly specified originally, how do you know whether
or not these lines of code are useful? </p>

<p >I have found there are similarities with research and
development, management consulting, and financial analysis, unfortunately, I

<p ><span class=GramE>people</span> don't do what they are told</p>

<p >In Bringing out the Best in People, Aubrey Daniels wrote
&quot;If we always did what we were told, we would eat only nutritious foods,
never drink too much alcohol, and exercise regularly.&quot; There is thus a
natural limit on the effectiveness of written policies and management by
telling then nagging.</p>

<p >A corollary to this principle is that people do what you
reward them to do, not what you hope they will do. Often, when you look at what
is truly rewarded in an organization, you find it is different than what you
think is rewarded. Do the managers have an engineering background? If not,
they'll probably be unable to perceive when a programmer is accomplishing
nothing. So the programmer who does nothing gets a paycheck at the end of the
month. Having thus been rewarded for doing nothing, the programmer tries it
again the next month...</p>

<p ><span class=GramE>all</span> performers get the right
consequences every day</p>

<p >The natural way to manage is to spend time with people who
aren't doing a good job. You help them out. You remind them of the good things
that can happen to them if they finish a project or raise the <span
class=SpellE>spectre</span> of their being laid off the next time the company
needs to improve its profitability. These are probably the right consequences
for someone who is underperforming. But what about the people who are
performing? What if you ignore them day-to-day? Unless they are getting
positive reinforcement from another source, they may stop coming in on the
weekends to get a release out the door earlier, stop documenting their code,
stop writing journal articles. A top performer won't sink to the level of a
problem employee but that person may become average. And in the long run a
company with average workers will at best earn an average return on equity.</p>

<p ><span class=GramE>small</span>, immediate, certain
consequences are better than large, future, uncertain ones</p>

<p >An annual review and bonus is not classically considered a
very good way to motivate people. It is too far away, especially in an internet
economy. Even if a worker is able to keep the bonus goal fixed in his or her
head for the 365 days preceding the bonus allocation, there is uncertainty
attached to it. What if the company is doing really badly at the end of the
year? Will there still be a bonus?</p>

<p >Positive reinforcement is more effective than negative
reinforcement</p>

<p >Ben Shapiro is a good friend (I've been on the board of
United Stationers with him for 10 years), an excellent student of human
behavior, and a great professor at Harvard. He has told me several stories over
the last decade, I will paraphrase a few hear to make a point. Like most
schools worldwide, Harvard practices negative reinforcement at the
undergraduate level. If a student does not do a problem set by a certain
deadline, they give him or her bad grade. This has turned out to be extremely
effective at ensuring that a Harvard graduate has achieved some minimum
standard. However, the students don't accomplish all that they could. The first
term that <span class=GramE>Ben<span >&nbsp;
</span>taught</span> , He gave the students one week to do a Problem Set.
Apparently it was pretty tough and some of them had to work all night the last
two nights. Ben decided he should be kinder and gentler the next semester. So
we gave them two weeks to do the same homework assignment. The first week went
by. The students were working on other classes, playing sports on the lawn,
going out with friends. They didn't start working on the problem set until a
few days before it was due and ended up pulling a few all nighters just has his
previous semesters class had. </p>

<p >We thus proved the management adage that a deadline just
gives someone an excuse to procrastinate and do nothing until the very end.</p>

<p >Graduate school at Harvard is different. They want the
students to do research, write up their results, publish them in journals, and
graduate with a reasonably interesting PhD thesis. If a student finishes some
research, the most effective faculty advisors immediately provides positive
reinforcement by paying attention, helping design the next experiment, helping
to draft a paper outline. If the student finishes a write-up, he or she is
positively reinforced by being sent to a conference to present it. If the
student finishes a PhD thesis, he or she is positively reinforced by being
given a 3-7X pay raise.</p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p ><span class=GramE>The lesson from Harvard?</span> Negative
reinforcement can work if the organization is extremely tightly managed, if the
consequences are small and immediate (usually a problem set is due every week
and only represents a part of the final grade), and if the goal is to make sure
that everyone comes up to a reasonable level. However, the worldwide fame of
Harvard rests on research achievements by graduate students. This innovation is
mostly supported by positive reinforcement.</p>

<p ><span class=GramE>ownership</span> leads to high productivity</p>

<p >A related issue to positive/negative reinforcement is
ownership. Non-ownership systems discipline those who are not working up to the
minimum standard, but they do not offer enough of an upside to truly motivate
people. <span class=SpellE>Morever</span>, non-ownership systems demand a very
accurate setting of standards. Ownership-oriented systems include contingent
rewards with an almost unlimited upside, and are thus effective at getting as
much discretionary effort out of workers as possible.</p>

<p >As an example, in the early days of <span class=SpellE>Neoglyphics</span><span
class=GramE>, <span >&nbsp;</span>we</span> had only a
handful of customers: Sears, Citibank, Wal-Mart, Playboy, Hallmark, and ABN-<span
class=SpellE>Amro</span>. . We had only a handful of programmers as well and
hence the easiest way to divide the work was to give a programmer total
responsibility for one project. The programmer owned that customer. If the
project went well and the customer wrote us a big check, we gave a huge bonus to
the programmer. If any project had gone poorly and we'd been fired by a
customer, we would not have had to think very hard to figure out who was
responsible (fortunately this never happened while I was running the company!).
People worked insanely hard to make their projects successful and their clients
happy. More importantly, the programmer who did an entire project by him or
herself learned enough to train new people, lead a larger project, etc.</p>

<p >After we grew beyond the 40-person mark, pressures to dilute
the ownership aspects of our organization grew. We wanted to grow
rapidly--nobody wants to buy enterprise software from a small company. As our
reputation grew, customers came to us with larger projects. We believed that
many of our developers were too junior to handle complete responsibility for
these large projects. Our costs went up because we had to coordinate the
diffused responsibility. In the summer of 1997, when we had 100 or so
employees, one of our clients was unhappy (CSX Railroad). It took a week just
to arrange a meeting among the five managers who bore collective responsibility
for the project. <span >&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile,
individual productivity fell. It was taking more programmer-months and more
calendar months to get things done. On weekend mornings you could walk naked
through an entire floor of our headquarters building without fear of
embarrassment.</p>

<p >Building and keeping a good software engineering team</p>

<p >What is the best way to attract some good software engineers
to your organization? As I said at the beginning, hire a few to begin with.
Good people like to work with other good people. This is true in every field
but much more acute in software engineering. Why? Consider two management
consultants working on different projects but within the same organization. If
Consultant A does a bad job it harms Consultant B's reputation to some extent
but does not require Consultant B to take any action. Whereas in most tech
companies if Programmer A does a bad job it usually means that Programmer B
will eventually be forced to use the bad code, read the bad code, and then fix
the bad code.</p>

<p >What attracts good programmers? Traditionally the best
programmers seek the most challenging problems. They want to work in an
organization that is trying to build something important. Programmers have huge
and fragile egos. If they are somehow assigned to a trivial problem and that is
their only possible task, they may spend six months coming up with a
bewildering architecture more complex Windows 7 operating system, merely so
that they can show their friends and colleagues what a tough nut they are
trying to crack. Another source of ego-gratification for programmers is to have
other programmers admiring their work. Open-source software projects thus have
a big recruiting advantage over closed-source software companies.</p>

<p >What kind of working environment is necessary for programmer
satisfaction? Good programmers want to achieve and therefore removing barriers
to achievement is the most important step that one can take in creating an
effective working environment. Programmers dread elaborate process, endless meetings,
and layers of marketing approval before a product can be shipped. Ideally it
would be possible to conceive a product on Friday evening, set up the
development environment Friday night, write code on Saturday and Sunday, test
on Sunday night, and ship on Monday morning. Maintaining this kind of freedom
is a serious challenge as a company grows and its products become more complex.
Successful companies such as Oracle Corporation burden their marketing
departments with overlapping products rather than stifle programmer initiative.
For example, during most of the early 2000's there were at least three
different Web servers that you could buy from Oracle, each one backed up by a
document explaining why it was the one true path toward database-backed Web site
glory.</p>

<p >A good physical working environment is essential. Great
programmers get a lot of positive reinforcement from their work itself. They
write some code and immediately can see it dance. That keeps them at work for
hours that, while they would not impress a taxi driver in Singapore or a
factory worker in Guangzhou, will surprise many American business people. When
we hired an architect to lay out the interior of Orbitz first office in <span
class=SpellE>Chciago</span> he surveyed the programmers and came back shaking
his head: &quot;I've never seen any group of people who spend so many hours
continuously sitting at their desks.&quot;</p>

<p >From a business point of view, long hours by programmers are
a key to profitability. Suppose that a programmer needs to spend 25 hours per
week keeping current with new technology, getting coordinated with other
programmers, contributing to documentation and thought leadership pieces, and
comprehending the structures of the systems being extended. Under this
assumption, a programmer who works 55 hours per week will produce twice as much
code as one who works 40 hours per week. Fred Brooks concludes in the Mythical
Man Month that no software product should be designed by more than two people
(sound familiar to my agile training class?). He argues that a program designed
by more than two people might be more complete but it will never be easy to
understand because it will not be as consistent as something designed by fewer
people. This means that if you want to follow the best practices of the
industry in terms of design and architecture, the only way to improve speed to
market is to have the same people working longer hours. Finally there is the
common sense notion that the smaller the team the less management overhead. A
product is going to get out the door much faster if it is built by 4 people
working 70-hour weeks (180 productive programmer-hours per week, after
subtracting for 25 hours of coordination and structure comprehension time) than
if by 12 people working 40-hour weeks (the same net of 180 hours per week). The
12-person team will inevitably require additional managers and all-day meetings
to stay coordinated, and will start to create code dependencies between the
developers, slowing down the progress of the <span class=SpellE>the</span> most
productive (which we've already talked about being 100x more productive).</p>

<p >Thus, our business success will depend on the extent to which
programmers live at our office. For this to be a common choice, our office had
better be nicer than the average programmer's home. There are two ways to achieve
this result. One is to hire programmers who live in extremely shabby
apartments. The other is to create a nice office. Microsoft understands this.
In the early 1990s they did radio spots with John Cleese as a spokesman. One of
the main points of the ad was to ridicule the cheap open-plan offices in which
programmers were traditionally housed and promote the fact that at Microsoft
each developer gets a plush personal office. (I added a separate essay below on
how to make our offices attractive to developers)</p>

<p >How can an office be nicer than one's home? Let's consider
the following dimensions:</p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>social</span></p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>physical</span> comfort</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>aesthetic</span></p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>entertainment</span></p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>attractive</span> </p>

<p >Social</p>

<p >It is easy for an office to beat the home on the social
dimension, especially if the programmer lives alone. If there are people at
work at all times of day and night and you've succeeded in building an
organization of good people, ipso facto there is always someone interesting to
talk to at the office. To exploit fully the social possibilities of the
programmers' office, it is important to have informal gathering spaces. At the
MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which has nurtured groups of great
programmers for nearly 40 years, the gathering spaces are referred to as
&quot;playrooms&quot;. These contain sofas and coffee tables, movable in the
best tradition of Dewey, where programmers eat, talk, and occasionally listen
to presentations. Usually a playroom will have some sort of shared writing
surface such as a whiteboard. Note that these playrooms also are an important
part of an organization's knowledge management system. You need to give
programmers from different projects a place to meet where problems can be
discussed and solutions from older/other projects can be suggested. Every GREAT
development house has this area (check out a playroom at <span class=SpellE>google</span>:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/silvery/415209104/) </p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p >A social place will never be friendly if it is trapped behind
a high wall of security. It ought to be very easy for a programmer to invite a
friend over. If programmers are comfortable meeting their friends at the office
it greatly increases the likelihood of friends recruiting friends &#8211; the
most effective form of recruiting I have ever seen.</p>

<p >An open office plan contributes to making the work
environment stronger on the social dimension.</p>

<p >Physical Comfort</p>

<p >A programmer's work environment should be a supremely
comfortable place to sit, look at information on a screen, and type. At G2 we
accomplished this via providing Aeron chairs, the keyboard of the programmer's
choice, and at least two monitors. In the summer, we spent the money to keep
the offices air-conditioned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. In the winter,
the office was heated and humidified (often neglected). We added high-efficiency
mechanical filters and electronic cleaners so that allergy sufferers are not
discouraged from working &#8211; this turned out to be an issue in the Sears
Tower which apparently neglects the cleaning of their air duct system.</p>

<p >There is a lot of great information from Architect <span
class=SpellE>Geral</span> McCue Online &#8211; he actually did research on
efficient development space for <span class=GramE>IBM .</span> <span
>&nbsp;</span>He found that each worker needed 100
square feet of dedicated space and 30 square feet of work surface. McCue also
found that programmers needed noise isolation from enclosed offices or high
partitions. This is a rule I have broken on occasion if the company has
sufficient development staff to do agile pairing, but requires even more space
than McCue suggests. Given the horrendous commercial real estate environment,
we would do well to get a much bigger space for less money. </p>

<p >Aesthetic</p>

<p >Programmers don't have the same need for wood-paneled
expensive plushness that, say, corporate lawyers or investment bankers might.
However, the office has to be aesthetically satisfying or it will be tough for
anyone to take seriously the idea that the company values aesthetic internal
design of computer programs. Similarly, the office has to be finished and
well-executed or nobody will believe that the organization is committed to
finishing products. In the long run it is impossible for an organization to be
excellent in one area and mediocre in all others. So the physical facilities
have to look as though they were planned and decorated by someone with taste. Note
that this need not be expensive. I've done <span class=GramE>it <span
>&nbsp;</span>with</span> $200 desks from Ikea and a
consistent set of art posters on the walls. But an expensive facility with
blank walls and boxes left over from the last move screams incompetence.
Remember that the overall place has to look nicer than most of the programmers'
houses.</p>

<p >Entertainment</p>

<p >It is easy to make an office more entertaining than the
average person's home. Most people have a TV at home but they don't have
friends with whom to watch it. Nor will they typically have the kind of
big-screen equipment that is easy for us to acquire. In the 1980s students at
the MIT Media Lab would gather on quite a few nights to watch movies from
analog <span class=SpellE>laserdisks</span>, presented with a very high quality
projector. After the movie was over, they'd go back to their desks and work for
a few hours, something that would not have happened if they'd gone out to the
movies.</p>

<p >The average home cannot accommodate a pinball machine. An
office can. The average home can have video games, which are very popular with
young programmers, but not people with whom to play. The average home cannot
have a grand piano but almost any office can.</p>

<p >Attractive</p>

<p >A worthwhile goal is to have at least one thing that is
extremely attractive about the physical environment for any particular
prospective software engineer. Here's a possible list:</p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
dog-friendly policy</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>grand</span> piano</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
climbing wall</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>indoor</span> garden</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>aquarium</span></p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>koi</span> pond</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
exercise room </p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>pinball</span>, foosball, or other large physical multi-person
gaming equipment</p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p >Not everyone has a dog. Not everyone can play the piano. Not
everyone wants to practice rock climbing. But by having a long list in the same
building, there is a good chance that at least one item will be very attractive
to a particular person. If a person loves gardens, he or she can be seated at a
desk within view of the garden. That person won't value the other items,
perhaps, but another employee will.</p>

<p >Change of Venue</p>

<p >You can work on all of the preceding dimensions but there
will come a day when a programmer gets restless. Sitting at exactly the same
desk every day is tedious. We thought that we could solve this at <span
class=SpellE>Neoglyphics</span> by using the Internet and our branch offices.
We'd encourage programmers from <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Bucktown</span></span><span
class=GramE> <span >&nbsp;</span>to</span> pick up and
work at a spare desk in the Champaign, New Jersey, or Los Gatos offices for a
week or two. The idea did not catch on, however, because it turns out to be
disruptive for one person on a team to disappear. One of the reasons we've
found open-plan offices effective is that it helps to have one's team members
close enough to look casually at what is on the screen.</p>

<p >What does it take to let the entire team pick up and work
somewhere else for awhile? <span class=GramE>A beach house or a ski house
within a two-hour drive of their main office.</span> It is kind of expensive
for an individual to rent a vacation house year-around, equip it with a DSL
line or cable modem, and pack it with enough desks and computers for a team to
work. But if you've got a group of 30 programmers and get a house large enough
for 6 or so to sleep and work, the cost is manageable. In the winter, a
programming team can disappear for a week, ski every morning and work all
afternoon and evening. In the summer, a team can spend a week looking out at
the ocean... while typing most of the time. It costs more than not having the
beach house but a lot less than having employees go off on their own to have
fun every weekend and not work. </p>

<p >(Next section has been added &#8211; another manifesto I
wrote on how to nurture talent)</p>

<p >Turning average programmers into good programmers</p>

<p >It is difficult to hire the most productive programmers in
the world. Oftentimes these people are capable, by themselves, of turning out
entire products, and thus they start their own companies. If a really
productive programmer works for an established organization, that organization
will usually take extreme steps to keep him or her. Thus beyond a certain point
it is most effective for an organization to develop a strategy for creating
good programmers internally.</p>

<p >How does one create a good programmer? Raw materials are
important. You want someone with a strong computer science education, a high
IQ, and an ability to communicate effectively in oral presentations and in
writing. But without the right experience, such a person will never be more
than an average quality programmer.</p>

<p >These principles are important in building up someone's
programming skills:</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1. A
person won't become proficient at something until he or she has done it many
times. <span class=GramE>In other words.</span> <span class=GramE>if</span> you
want someone to be really good at building a software system, he or she will
have to have built 10 or more systems of that type (The Book ÒOutliersÓ which
is your typically fun <span class=SpellE>Gladwell</span> read argues it takes
10,000 hours to become an ÒexpertÓ).</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2. A
person won't retain proficiency at a task unless he or she has at one time
learned to perform that task very rapidly. Learning research demonstrates that
the skills of people who become accurate but not fast deteriorate much sooner
than the skills of people who become both accurate and fast.</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3.
Technology shifts force a programmer to go through bursts of learning every
year or two. </p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p >Look around our organization. You can make a list of the
people qualified to design and build a new system by counting up those who've
built 10 or more similar systems in the past, at least two in the last year,
and that could do the entire job in a month or two if they really had to. These
are your &quot;good programmers&quot;. Everyone else is a candidate to be
turned into a good programmer as quickly as possible.</p>

<p >Learning to design and build software systems requires that
the programmer design and build software systems. These can be smaller
subprojects for internal or external customers, standalone software system for non-profit
organizations, or demonstration systems to be written up and distributed to
other programmers. A particularly effective option that is only available in
the Web world is to build and launch a free public service. Thus, if you've
ever read the self-evaluation form I typically post to hire software
developers, you now know why I ask if they have ever developed a site over a
weekend.</p>

<p >Whatever the training task, the pace must be ruthlessly
brisk. The learner should be expected to build at the same pace as an
experienced developer. The difference between the learner and the wizard is
that you expect the learner to make a lot of mistakes. The system as built may
be awkward or not handle error cases properly. That's okay. Training research
shows that if you get speed now you can get quality later. But if you don't get
speed you will never get quality in the long run. </p>

<p >If you see one of your best people walking out the door at
6:00 pm, try to think why you haven't challenged that person with an
interesting project. If you see one of your average programmers walking out the
door at 6:00 pm, recognize that this person is not developing into a good
programmer. An average programmer's productivity will never be significant in a
group of good programmers. If you care about profits, you must either come up
with a new training program for the person or figure out the best way to
terminate his or her employment with your organization.</p>

<p >Still not convinced? Take a look at the Japanese &quot;code
factory&quot; circa 1990. These precisely organized large organizations where
each person had his role, however small, were supposed to overtake the American
approach where small teams of craftsmen worked in a comparatively disorganized
manner. The factory approach sometimes produces acceptable corporate IT
solutions but for innovation and successful product development, the craft
approach has been overwhelmingly vindicated.</p>

<p >Turning good programmers into good managers</p>

<p >As noted in my earlier manifesto, software engineering is
different because the organization can't afford to lose the individual
productivity of the best people as they are pushed into management. At Orbitz
for example, a manager who is one or two levels up from the title Òsenior <span
class=SpellE>developerÓwas</span> still expected to write code, develop SQL
data models, write system design documents, and write journal articles. Yet
managers who are spending a portion of their time designing software or writing
documentation are at risk of neglecting their duties to review subordinates'
work.</p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p >A classic problem I have seen over and over is a manager
getting lost in his or her own work and failing to review a subordinate's
efforts for two or three months. When the review occurs, inevitably the
subordinate has either been working on the wrong thing in the wrong way or
hasn't been sufficiently productive. At this point the manager is really angry.
Three months of calendar time and money have been wasted. But should the
manager be angry with the employee? If the manager had reviewed the subordinate
every week, the company would never have been at risk of losing more than one
week of time and money.</p>

<p >This is where more modern development frameworks have really
been successful. Extreme Programming, and Agile for example decouple
responsibility for review from responsibility for scheduling review. Administrative
assistants, or calendar <span class=GramE>apps <span
>&nbsp;</span>can</span> be used to ensure that each
manager is scheduled to look at every subordinate's work at least once per
week, more frequently in the case of junior employees. It has proven remarkably
more effective when a neutral third-party is responsible for scheduling than
when people with incentives to shirk are responsible for scheduling.</p>

<p >Management by Consensus Considered Harmful</p>

<p >Leaf-node engineers at every company on this planet think
that they have better business ideas than the senior managers. Why not simply
turn the company over to the engineers to run? Each engineer has a different
set of better business ideas.</p>

<p >Software engineering companies will tend to have a fairly flat
distribution of intelligence. The 22-year-old Stanford CS punk that was just
hired will be just as smart as the 30-year-old lead engineer who will be just
as smart as the 40-year-old CEO (that's me :&gt;). Within a company's technical
team, the raw IQ differences are even smaller. If each member of the team were
playing the Bach Partitas and Sonatas for Solo Violin, the wrong notes, shaky
intonation, and bad phrasing would make it pretty obvious to the novices that
they needed to take advice from the experts. But because software quality is
tough to measure and software quantity is seldom measured, the novices in a
software engineering group are able to think of themselves as experts.</p>

<p >What would be wrong with a completely egalitarian software
engineering group? Maybe the entire team really is at the same level of
ability. And suppose that somehow the challenge of getting everyone to attack
the same problem had been surmounted. Remember what Fred Brooks said in The
Mythical Man-Month: high quality systems must be architected by no more than
two people.</p>

<p >Getting design input from leaf-node engineers is important
for having a good product design. But at the end of the day nobody should be
confused as to who is providing leadership. There is an irreducible amount of
Engineer A imposing his or her design on Engineer B. This can lead to some
harsh-sounding words and bruised feelings. Microsoft is not the self-esteem
company, at least if you believe Playboy magazine's interview with Bill Gates:
&quot;We hear you were brusque at times, that you won't hesitate to tell
someone their idea is the stupidest thing you've ever heard. It's been called
management by embarrassment challenging employees and even leaving some in
tears.&quot; Truly elite organizations can be far worse than Microsoft. Ask a
group of surgical interns and residents how much respect they get from the
surgeons. Go into a world-class biology department and ask the grad students
and post-docs about their treatment at the hands of the professors. Thus, you
now understand why I ask the question about taking both sides of an argument in
my self-assessment questionnaire</p>

<p >Wherever You Go, There You Are</p>

<p >Performance management textbooks will tell you that workers
don't improve unless they get feedback. Joe <span class=SpellE>Widgetmaker</span>
should get a nice chart, updated daily, of how many widgets he has produced
personally each day and how many have been built by his team.</p>

<p >Consider the average working programmer's life:</p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
surfing <span class=SpellE>sourceforge</span></p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* <span
class=GramE>surfing</span> Slashdot</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
reading docs</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
questioning colleagues</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
writing specs and designs</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
writing docs</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
writing code</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
testing code</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
fixing bugs</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
filing bug reports on others' code</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
attending meetings</p>

<p ><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*
helping sales and marketing staff </p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p >Characterizing this person's productivity is going to require
more than one number. But if we don't do it, days or weeks could slip by
without the programmer realizing that his or her achievement levels are
plummeting. In a company with disorganized or technically clueless managers,
the programmer's supervisory chain won't notice the lack of achievement either.</p>

<p ><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p >Production of documentation and code is generally measurable
by reference to the company's version control system. Bugs filed and fixed are
easily tallied by looking at the company's ticket/bug tracking system. The
softer stuff can still be quantified but it will have to be done by humans
filling out forms.</p>

<p >Ideally the programmer will get daily feedback, which is kept
private unless the individual elects to publicize it &#8211; this is why Agile
has proven to be such a productivity enhancer. Performance in each sanctioned
area of activity will be marked up and scored with a weight. The programmer can
then see if his or her crude achievement level is going up or down. Building and
managing a peak-performing software engineering organization is challenging but
extremely profitable. The core <span class=SpellE>Ariba</span> product was
written by two programmers, yielding a market capitalization of $30 billion. </p>
